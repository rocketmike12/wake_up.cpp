## About

A C++ program to replicate the famous prompt on Neo's screen from "The Matrix"

## Installation

### Manual

#### Clone the repo
```shell
git clone https://github.com/rocketmike12/wake_up.cpp.git
```

#### Cd into the newly cloned folder
```shell
cd wake_up.cpp
```

#### Compile the binary
```shell
make
```
#### Copy the binary to /usr/bin/
```shell
sudo cp bin/wake_up /usr/bin/
```

## Usage

```shell
wake_up
```

## Support

Please note that this program was developed and intended for Linux. It uses system commands, such as "clear" and "read". I do not own a MacOS environment or a BSD environment (and too lazy to set up one), but any help with porting will be greatly appreciated.
